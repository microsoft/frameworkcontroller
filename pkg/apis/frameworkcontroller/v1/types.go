// A Framework represents an application with a set of Tasks:
// 1. Executed by Kubernetes Pod
// 2. Partitioned to different heterogeneous TaskRoles which share the same lifecycle
// 3. Ordered in the same homogeneous TaskRole by TaskIndex
// 4. With consistent identity {FrameworkName}-{TaskRoleName}-{TaskIndex} as PodName
// 5. With fine grained RetryPolicy for each Task and the whole Framework
// 6. With fine grained FrameworkAttemptCompletionPolicy for each TaskRole
// 7. Guarantees at most one instance of a specific Task is running at any point in time
// 8. Guarantees at most one instance of a specific Framework is running at any point in time
//
// Notes:
// 1. Status field should only be modified by FrameworkController, and
//    other fields should not be modified by FrameworkController.
//    TODO: Remove +genclient:noStatus after ApiServer has supported CRD Subresources.
//    Leverage CRD status subresource to isolate Status field modification with other fields.
//    This can help to avoid unintended modification, such as users may unintendedly modify
//    the status when updating the spec.
// 2. To ensure at most one instance of a specific Task is running at any point in time:
//    1. Do not delete the managed Pod with 0 gracePeriodSeconds.
//       For example, the default Pod deletion is acceptable.
//    2. Do not delete the Node which runs the managed Pod.
//       For example, drain before delete the Node is acceptable.
//    The instance can be universally located by its TaskAttemptInstanceUID or PodUID.
//    See RetryPolicySpec and TaskAttemptStatus.
// 3. To ensure at most one instance of a specific Framework is running at any point in time:
//    1. Ensure ensure at most one instance of a specific Task is running at any point in time.
//    2. Do not delete the managed ConfigMap with Background propagationPolicy.
//       For example, the default ConfigMap deletion is acceptable.
//    3. Must delete the Framework with Foreground propagationPolicy.
//       For example, the default Framework deletion may not be acceptable, since the default
//       propagationPolicy for Framework object may be Background.
//    The instance can be universally located by its FrameworkAttemptInstanceUID or ConfigMapUID.
//    See RetryPolicySpec and FrameworkAttemptStatus.
// 4. To ensure there is no orphan object previously managed by FrameworkController:
//    1. Do not delete the Framework or the managed ConfigMap with Orphan propagationPolicy.
//       For example, the default Framework and ConfigMap deletion is acceptable.
//    2. Do not change the OwnerReferences of the managed ConfigMap and Pods.

// RetryPolicySpec can be configured for the whole Framework and each TaskRole
// to control:
// 1. Framework RetryPolicy:
//    The conditions to retry the whole Framework after the Framework's current
//    FrameworkAttempt completed.
//    It can also be considered as Framework CompletionPolicy, i.e. the conditions
//    to complete the whole Framework.
// 2. Task RetryPolicy:
//    The conditions to retry a single Task in the TaskRole after the Task's
//    current TaskAttempt completed.
//    It can also be considered as Task CompletionPolicy, i.e. the conditions to
//    complete a single Task in the TaskRole.
//
// Usage:
// If the FancyRetryPolicy is enabled,
//   will retry if the completion is due to Transient Failed CompletionType,
//   will not retry if the completion is due to Permanent Failed CompletionType,
//   will apply the NormalRetryPolicy defined below if all above conditions are
//   not satisfied.
//
// If the FancyRetryPolicy is not enabled,
//   will directly apply the NormalRetryPolicy for all kinds of completions.
//
// The NormalRetryPolicy is defined as,
//   will retry and AccountableRetriedCount++ if MaxRetryCount == -2,
//   will retry and AccountableRetriedCount++ if the completion is due to any
//     failure and MaxRetryCount == -1,
//   will retry and AccountableRetriedCount++ if the completion is due to any
//     failure and AccountableRetriedCount < MaxRetryCount,
//   will not retry if all above conditions are not satisfied.
//
// After the retry is exhausted, the final CompletionStatus is defined as,
//   the CompletionStatus of the last attempt.
//
// Notes:
// 1. The existence of an attempt instance may not always be observed, such as
//    create fails but succeeds on remote and then followed by an external delete.
//    So, an attempt identified by its attempt id may be associated with multiple
//    attempt instances over time, i.e. multiple instances may be run for the
//    attempt over time, however, at most one instance is exposed into ApiServer
//    over time and at most one instance is running at any point in time.
//    So, the actual retried attempt instances maybe exceed the RetryPolicySpec
//    in rare cases, however, the RetryPolicyStatus will never exceed the
//    RetryPolicySpec.
// 2. Resort to other spec to control other kind of RetryPolicy:
//    1. Container RetryPolicy is the RestartPolicy in Pod Spec.
//       See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy
type RetryPolicySpec struct {

// CompletionPolicySpec can be configured for each TaskRole to control:
// 1. FrameworkAttempt CompletionPolicy:
//    1. The conditions to complete a FrameworkAttempt.
//    2. The CompletionStatus of the completed FrameworkAttempt.
//
// Usage:
// 1. If Pod Spec of current TaskRole is invalid, immediately complete the
//    FrameworkAttempt, regardless of any uncompleted Task, and the CompletionStatus
//    is failed which is generated from the Task which triggers the completion.
// 2. If MinFailedTaskCount != -1 and MinFailedTaskCount <= failed Task count of
//    current TaskRole, immediately complete the FrameworkAttempt, regardless of
//    any uncompleted Task, and the CompletionStatus is failed which is generated
//    from the Task which triggers the completion.
// 3. If MinSucceededTaskCount != -1 and MinSucceededTaskCount <= succeeded Task
//    count of current TaskRole, immediately complete the FrameworkAttempt, regardless
//    of any uncompleted Task, and the CompletionStatus is succeeded which is
//    generated from the Task which triggers the completion.
// 4. If multiple above 1. and 2. conditions of all TaskRoles are satisfied at the
//    same time, the behavior can be any one of these satisfied conditions.
// 5. If none of above 1. and 2. conditions of all TaskRoles are satisfied until all
//    Tasks of the Framework are completed, immediately complete the FrameworkAttempt
//    and the CompletionStatus is succeeded which is not generated from any Task.
//
// Notes:
// 1. When the FrameworkAttempt is completed, the FrameworkState is transitioned to
//    FrameworkAttemptCompleted, so the Framework may still be retried with another
//    new FrameworkAttempt according to the Framework RetryPolicySpec.
// 2. Resort to other spec to control other kind of CompletionPolicy:
//    1. Framework CompletionPolicy is equivalent to Framework RetryPolicy.
//    2. Task CompletionPolicy is equivalent to Task RetryPolicy.
//    3. TaskAttempt CompletionPolicy is equivalent to Pod CompletionPolicy,
//       i.e. the PodPhase conditions for PodSucceeded or PodFailed.
//       See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-phase

// Status
// It is used to:
// 1. Aggregate the ground truth from other related objects, such as Pod.Status.
// 2. Maintain the Framework owned ground truth, such as PodUID.
// 3. Retain the ground truth even if other related objects are deleted.
//
// Notes:
// 1. It should only contain current status, history status should be a different type
//    and stored in a history database.
// 2. For field which is not the ground truth, such as the TaskState, it should be
//    totally reconstructable from its ground truth, in case the Status is failed to
//    persist due to FrameworkController restart.
//    The ground truth may be other fields in Framework.Status or the fields in other
//    related objects, such as the PodUID and Pod.Status.
// 3. For field which is the ground truth, such as the PodUID, it should be
//    Monotonically Exposed which means it should only be changed to a future state in
//    ApiServer. However, it does not mean other related objects are also Monotonically
//    Exposed.
//    For example, from the view of any ApiServer client, the PodUID should be changed
//    from a not nil value to a different not nil value, if and only if its TaskAttemptID
//    is also increased.
// 4. It is better to keep the ground truth in other related objects instead of in the
//    Status here, so that the Framework can be more compatible with other k8s features,
//    such as labels and selectors.
